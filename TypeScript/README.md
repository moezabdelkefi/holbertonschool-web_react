This project serves as a comprehensive learning resource for understanding various fundamental concepts in TypeScript. Upon completion of this project, you will gain proficiency in the following areas without relying on external sources like Google:

## Learning Objectives:

### Basic Types in TypeScript:

Understanding and implementing different basic types available in TypeScript, including but not limited to string, number, boolean, array, tuple, enum, null, undefined, void, and any.

### Interfaces, Classes, and Functions:

Explaining the concepts of interfaces, their implementation in TypeScript, defining and using classes, as well as creating and utilizing functions.

### Working with the DOM and TypeScript:

Hands-on experience in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using TypeScript, enabling interaction and modification of HTML elements within a web page.

### Generic Types:

Understanding generic types in TypeScript to create reusable components or functions that can work with a variety of data types.

### Usage of Namespaces:

Exploring how to logically group and organize code using namespaces to prevent naming collisions and create more structured TypeScript applications.

### Merging Declarations:

Understanding the merging behavior of TypeScript declarations, including interfaces and modules, and how they can be combined or extended.

### Utilizing Ambient Namespace for External Library Import:

Implementing ambient namespaces to import and use external libraries in TypeScript projects seamlessly.

### Basic Nominal Typing:

Exploring the concept of nominal typing in TypeScript, allowing for more explicit type distinctions in certain scenarios.

### Compile TypeScript files:

                                            [Using TypeScript Compiler]
                                            tsc

                                            Or [Using package.json script]
                                            npm run build
