<h1 align="center">Redux reducer+selector</h1>

In a React Redux application, reducers and selectors play crucial roles in managing and accessing the state. Let's discuss what reducers and selectors are, and how they are used in a React Redux application:

## Redux Reducer:

A Redux reducer is a pure function that specifies how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. It takes the current state and an action as arguments, and returns the next state of the application. The reducer is responsible for updating the state immutably based on the action type.

## Features
- Redux store setup with a simple counter reducer
- React components connected to Redux store using useSelector and useDispatch hooks
- Increment, decrement, and reset functionalities for the counter

### Here's a basic structure of a Redux reducer:

                                            const initialState = {
                                              // Initial state properties
                                            };
                                            
                                            const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
                                              switch (action.type) {
                                                case 'ACTION_TYPE':
                                                  // Return the new state based on the action
                                                  return {
                                                    ...state,
                                                    // Updated properties
                                                  };
                                                // Additional cases for other action types
                                                default:
                                                  return state;
                                              }
                                            };
                                            
                                            export default reducer;


## Redux Selector:
A Redux selector is a function that computes derived data from the Redux store's state. It allows components to extract specific pieces of state from the store in a more organized and efficient way. Selectors help in keeping the Redux store's structure decoupled from the UI components, making it easier to manage and maintain.

### Here's an example of a Redux selector:

                                            import { createSelector } from 'reselect';
                                            
                                            const getCounter = state => state.counter;
                                            
                                            export const getDoubleCounter = createSelector(
                                              [getCounter],
                                              counter => counter * 2
                                            );

In this example, getDoubleCounter is a selector that takes the counter state and returns its double value. Reselect library is commonly used to create memoized selectors, which cache the results of expensive computations for better performance.

## How They Work Together:

Reducers are responsible for updating the state based on actions, while selectors are used to extract and compute derived data from the state. Components can then access the derived data using selectors, ensuring that they always have the most up-to-date information from the Redux store.

                                            import React from 'react';
                                            import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
                                            import { getDoubleCounter } from './selectors';
                                            
                                            const Component = () => {
                                              const doubleCounter = useSelector(getDoubleCounter);
                                            
                                              return (
                                                <div>
                                                  <h1>Double Counter: {doubleCounter}</h1>
                                                </div>
                                              );
                                            };
                                            
                                            export default Component;

## Conclusion:
Reducers and selectors are fundamental concepts in React Redux applications. Reducers manage the state mutations based on actions, while selectors provide a way to compute derived data from the state. By using reducers and selectors effectively, you can efficiently manage and access the state in your Redux-powered React applications.
