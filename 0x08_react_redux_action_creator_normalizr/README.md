<center> React Redux Action Creator + Normalizr</center>
This project demonstrates the integration of React, Redux, and Normalizr for efficient state management and data normalization within a React application.

## Overview
In modern web development, managing application state effectively is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications. React, Redux, and Normalizr are popular libraries that work together seamlessly to achieve this goal.

### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable UI components.
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, providing a single source of truth for application state and enabling predictable state mutations.
Normalizr: A utility for normalizing nested JSON-like data, simplifying the process of managing relational data within the Redux store.
This project showcases the use of Redux action creators along with Normalizr to fetch and manage normalized data from an API and update the Redux store accordingly.

## Features
Redux Action Creators: Implementing Redux action creators to manage asynchronous data fetching and state updates.
Normalizr Integration: Utilizing Normalizr to normalize nested API responses and maintain a normalized state structure.
Component Rendering: Demonstrating the rendering of React components based on the normalized state stored in the Redux store.

Modify Redux action creators (actions.js) to fetch data from your API endpoints.
Define entity schemas using Normalizr (schemas.js) to normalize your API responses.
Update Redux reducers (reducers.js) to handle normalized data updates in the Redux store.
Modify React components (components/) to render data from the Redux store as needed.
